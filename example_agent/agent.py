"""
This is an example Agent that has a number of Intent categories. Each category
**demonstrates** a specific set of features of the *Intents* library, and
particularly:

* :mod:`smalltalk` shows the fundamentals of Intents and their Parameters
* :mod:`rickroll` demonstrates how to use Context to restrict intent predictions
* :mod:`restaurant` shows how to define Custom Entities
* :mod:`travels` demonstrates the use of rich responses, such as Images, Cards
  and Quick Replies
