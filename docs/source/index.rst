Intents â›º
==========
**Intents** is an unofficial Python library to define and operate Dialogflow Agents with a simple,
code-first approach.

Why *Intents*
=============

Define Agents as Python classes
-------------------------------
Dialogflow UI is great, but we are coders. With *Intents* your Agent lives **within your software** project:
autocomplete, type hints and static code checks are back!

Versioning and Continuous Integration
-------------------------------------
With *Intents* you can **generate an Agent from code**, your developers
can work in branches, the right Agent can be generated and restored
programmatically in CI pipelines.

A Human-friendly prediction client
----------------------------------
The official Dialogflow Python client is not the most enjoyable piece of
sowftware you will experience as a developer. It gives you full control over the
Agent, but if you are simply interested in making
predictions and triggers, why not **keep it simple**?
