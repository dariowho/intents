Intents â›º
==========

**Intents** is a Python framework to define and operate Conversational
Agents with a simple, code-first approach. `Dialogflow ES <https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/>`_ is the primary
supported NLU service.

Why *Intents*
=============

Define Agents as Python classes
-------------------------------
Dialogflow UI is great, but we are coders. With *Intents* your Agent is defined
**within your software** project, with native Python structures. Autocomplete and
static code checks are back, to make your Agents more flexible, scalable and
maintainable.

Versioning and Continuous Integration
-------------------------------------
With *Intents* you can **generate an Agent from code**, your developers
can work in branches, the right Agent can be generated and restored
programmatically in CI pipelines.

Human-friendly Connectors
-------------------------
Agent definitions are service-agnostic. While built-in support for **Dialogflow ES**
is provided, you are free to develop connectors for any other platform. And
since your intents are classes, predictions will just be their instances.
