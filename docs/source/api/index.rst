Core API
========

The **Core API** of *Intents* can be used to define conversational agents with
standard Python code. Agent definitions are not specific to a particular
service; once your Agent is defined you can use one of the built-in
:ref:`Connectors` (or write your own) to deploy it and make predictions.
