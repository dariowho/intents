"""
The interpretation of an utterance may change depending on the context of the
conversation. Context-dependant dynamics in the conversation are modeled by the
**relations** intents have with each other. This module defines an API to
specify them.

.. note::

   Usage of relations is demonstrated in the :mod:`example_agent.shop` module of
   the Example Agent

Inheritance
===========
Since we define intents as Python classes, we can reuse of one of the founding
concepts of object oriented programming: **inheritance**.

.. code-block:: python

    @dataclass
    class AskCoffee(Intent):
        \"\"\"Hello, I'd like a light roast coffee\"\"\"
        roast_level: CoffeeRoastLevel = "medium"

    @dataclass
    class AskEspresso(AskCoffee):
        \"\"\"Hello, I'd like a dark roast espresso.\"\"\"

An intent should subclass another when its meaning **includes and specifies**
the meaning of the other intent. When an intent is a subclass of another:

    * It will inherit all **parameters**, types and default values of the parent intent
    * It will inherit all the other **relations** of the parent intent
    * It will be rendered as a separate, independent intent

      * It will **not** inherit language data such as example utterances and responses

Follow
======

The **follow** relation is a context constraint: an intent that follows another
one can only be predicted after the followed one.

.. code-block:: python

    from intents import follow

    @dataclass
    class AddMilk(Intent):
        \"\"\"With milk please\"\"\"
        parent_ask_coffee: AskCoffee = follow()

An intent should follow another when it only makes sense in the parent's
context. In the example, it doesn't make sense to walk into a cafÃ¨ and utter
"With milk please"; however, it does make sense to say so after asking for a
coffee.

Context parameters can be accessed with another OOP fundamental concept:
**composition**.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> prediction = connector.predict("I want a dark roast espresso")
    >>> prediction = connector.predict("With milk please")
    >>> prediction.intent.parent_ask_coffee.roast_level
    "dark"

This relation is implemented by looking at the **lifespan** of intents.
`AskCoffee` starts with a lifespan of 5 (at the moment this is constant and
can't be configured). This value is decremented at each conversation turn;
intents that follow `AskCoffee` can only be predicted while its lifespan is > 0.

It's worth noting that the *follow* relation is **inherited** by subclasses:

* If intent `AskEspresso` is a subclass of `AskCoffee`, and `AddMilk` follows
  `AskCoffe`, then `AddMilk` also follows `AskEspresso`.
* If intent `AskSkimmedMilk` is a subclass of `AskMilk`, and `AskMilk` follows
  `AskCoffee`, then `AskSkimmedMilk` also follows `AskCoffee` (and `AskEspresso`
  in the example above)
